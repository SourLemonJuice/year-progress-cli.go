# year-progress-cli.go

Same as [SourLemonJuice/year-progress-cli](https://github.com/SourLemonJuice/year-progress-cli) but rewritten with The Go Programming Language.\
I want to use those rewrites to improve my language skills.

## Build

Build the executable file by running:

```text
go build -o <file_path> ./...
# or use script to build to build/year-progress.go.bin
./make.sh
```

## Version semantic

```text
Version <upstream_major>.<upstream_minor>-<rewrite_major>.<rewrite_patch>
```
